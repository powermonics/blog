<p>Powermonics is a blog about power, how it is built, exercised, and lost through money and technology. I explore history, geopolitics, and modern systems, with a strong focus on mechanisms and less on events.
</p><p>
This is not a news site or an academic journal. Essays here are long-form, reflective, offering my perspective on how and why something happened. I’m a software engineer by training with an interest in history, political economy, and geopolitics.

This is a personal project. Some content is for free, but the deeper analysis is reserved for subscribers.
